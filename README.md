cucumber leaf diseases

The timely detection of diseases on plant leaves is of utmost importance for increasing the efficiency of product production. To this end, a unique dataset was created and studied in this work to detect the specific types of cucumber plant leaves and diseases early. In particular, the health status of cucumber plants was investigated. Images of cucumber plants were gathered from various planting areas in Samsun (Carsamba plain, Gungor farm) and Mersin (Silifke Cay farm) provinces located in Turkey. To construct the dataset, images were captured using both a Redmi Note 9 Pro AI quad camera and a Samsung A51 quad rear camera. The dataset comprises plants infected with fusarium and mildew. The dataset is designed to provide a comprehensive representation of the different disease types that may afflict cucumber plants. The aim is to enable the accurate classification of each disease to improve disease diagnosis and management in the agricultural industry.
